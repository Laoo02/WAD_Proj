    <h3>Description:</h3>

    <p>
        <i>The Classic and Simple Style 38 features traditional design features such as a convex dial and domed glass. The series has been a consistent best-seller over the last decade in 70 countries and regions around the world. Until now, they featured mostly 40.5-mm case diameters, however these latest models feature a more compact 38-mm case. Global watch trends are shifting from large watches with a bold presence to smaller watches that fit comfortably on the wrist. Furthermore, there has been a particular trend towards simple watches displaying only the time using ageless designs with classical looks. It features both these trends in a size that suits both men and women. This is powered by Orientâ€™s automatic in-house 46-F6 series caliber F6724 movement providing high performance and reliability. The beautiful finishing on the movement can be admired through the see-through case back, and the domed glass and convex dial with simple bar indices create a vintage feel. </i>
